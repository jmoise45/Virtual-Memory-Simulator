# Virtual-Memory-Simulator
C++ program that emulate the operating system’s responsibility of allocating memory to certain programs. This is a very simple page-based view of memory management. On startup, the program has 32 pages of contiguous, unused memory. Each page is 4 KB long. It should then allow the users to “run” programs that require chunks of this memory for some period of time. It should also allow the users to “kill” programs(i.e., “Ctrl-c” or “kill -9” in most OSs) that are in progress. The pages used by programs that are killed can then be re-used for future programs.
